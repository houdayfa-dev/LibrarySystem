# 📚 Library Management System (C++)

## Overview

This project is a **console-based Library Management System written in C++**. It was built to practice and strengthen **core programming fundamentals** such as structs, enums, arrays, functions, and menu-driven programs.

The program allows users to enter book data and perform basic operations like listing books, finding the oldest book, counting available books, and filtering books by category.

---

## Features

* Add and store information for **5 books**
* Display **all books** with full details
* Find and display the **oldest published book**
* Count how many books are currently **available**
* Filter and display books by **category**
* Menu-driven interface with **input validation**

---

## Concepts Practiced

* `struct` for data modeling
* `enum` for menus and categories
* Arrays
* Functions and return values
* Input validation and control flow
* Switch statements
* Separation of logic into reusable functions

This project intentionally avoids advanced topics (OOP, STL containers, external libraries) to focus on **solid fundamentals**.

---

## Book Categories

* Fiction
* Non-Fiction
* Science
* Biography

## How to Run the Program

### Requirements

* C++ compiler (GCC, Clang, or MSVC)

### Compile

```bash
g++ LibrarySystem.cpp -o LibrarySystem
```

### Run

```bash
./LibrarySystem
```

(On Windows)

```bash
LibrarySystem.exe
```

## Sample Operations

* Print all stored books
* Show the oldest book by publication year
* Count available books
* Display books from a selected category

## Why This Project Matters

> "Strong fundamentals are more important than frameworks for junior developers."
> — Senior Software Engineer, FreeCodeCamp Community

This project demonstrates:

* Clear logic
* Readable code structure
* Understanding of basic C++ building blocks

---

## Future Improvements

* Replace fixed-size arrays with dynamic containers
* Add file storage (save/load books)
* Apply Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)
* Improve input validation robustness
